# DotNetMastery

## Overview
**DotNetMastery** is an extensive open-source repository designed to cover the entire world of **C#** and **.NET** programming. The project encompasses everything from basic syntax and data structures to advanced design patterns, architectural principles, and integrations with databases and cloud platforms.

Whether you're a beginner, an intermediate developer, or an expert, this repository serves as a one-stop resource to:
- Learn **C# language features** from the ground up.
- Implement and explore **data structures** and **algorithms** using C#.
- Dive deep into **design patterns** and software architecture.
- Master real-world **database integrations** and **advanced frameworks**.
- Apply modern development practices with testing, CI/CD, and DevOps integration.

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive, structured, and well-documented collection of resources to help developers at all levels enhance their understanding of C# and .NET, while also contributing back to the developer community.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following major sections:

1. **C# Language Features**  
   Covering everything from beginner to advanced C# concepts:
   - Basic syntax, data types, and control flow
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - LINQ, async/await, delegates, and more
   - New language features introduced in recent versions of C#

2. **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
   Explore classic and advanced data structures and algorithms implemented in C#:
   - Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
   - Trees, Binary Search Trees, Graphs, Heaps
   - Sorting and searching algorithms

3. **Design Patterns**  
   Implement the most popular design patterns using C#, including:
   - Creational (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
   - Structural (Adapter, Proxy, Decorator)
   - Behavioral (Observer, Strategy, Command)

4. **Database Integrations**  
   Learn how to connect C# applications to databases and manage data effectively:
   - Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
   - NoSQL integration using MongoDB
   - Repository and Unit of Work patterns
   - Optimizing database queries and handling migrations

5. **Architectures**  
   Gain practical experience with modern software architectures:
   - Microservices with .NET and Docker
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
   - Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
   - Building scalable RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core

6. **Testing & DevOps**  
   Understand best practices for testing, continuous integration, and DevOps:
   - Unit testing and integration testing
   - Test-driven development (TDD)
   - Setting up CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps

7. **Sample Applications**  
   See all the concepts in action with real-world sample applications:
   - A CQRS-based to-do app
   - A real-time chat app using SignalR and Blazor
   - Microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes
