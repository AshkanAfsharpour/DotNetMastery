# Testing & DevOps To-Do List

## 1. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**

- [ ] **Unit Testing Basics**
  - [ ] Understand the purpose and benefits of unit testing.
  - [ ] Learn about testable code principles and design patterns.
  
- [ ] **Choosing a Testing Framework**
  - [ ] Set up xUnit or NUnit for unit testing in .NET.
  - [ ] Explore the differences between xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest.
  
- [ ] **Writing Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Write tests for individual methods and classes.
  - [ ] Use assertions to validate the behavior of your code.
  
- [ ] **Mocking Dependencies**
  - [ ] Use Moq or NSubstitute to create mocks for external dependencies.
  - [ ] Test code that interacts with databases, APIs, or other services.

- [ ] **Integration Testing Basics**
  - [ ] Understand the purpose of integration testing and how it differs from unit testing.
  - [ ] Identify components that need to be tested together.
  
- [ ] **Writing Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Set up integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.
  - [ ] Use a test database or in-memory database (e.g., SQLite) for testing data access.

- [ ] **Test Coverage**
  - [ ] Measure code coverage with tools like Coverlet or Visual Studio's built-in coverage tools.
  - [ ] Aim for a good balance between coverage and meaningful tests.

## 2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

- [ ] **TDD Fundamentals**
  - [ ] Understand the TDD cycle: Red (write failing test), Green (write code to pass the test), Refactor (improve code).
  
- [ ] **Writing Tests First**
  - [ ] Practice writing unit tests before implementing functionality.
  - [ ] Use tests to drive the design of your code.
  
- [ ] **Refactoring with Confidence**
  - [ ] Refactor code while ensuring that all tests pass.
  - [ ] Understand when and how to refactor without breaking existing functionality.

- [ ] **Testing Legacy Code**
  - [ ] Write characterization tests to document the behavior of legacy code.
  - [ ] Refactor legacy code incrementally, using tests as a safety net.

## 3. **Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines with Azure DevOps**

- [ ] **Understanding CI/CD Concepts**
  - [ ] Learn about Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) principles.
  - [ ] Understand the benefits of CI/CD in modern software development.

- [ ] **Setting Up Azure DevOps**
  - [ ] Create an Azure DevOps account and set up a new project.
  - [ ] Familiarize yourself with Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, and Azure Artifacts.

- [ ] **Creating Build Pipelines**
  - [ ] Set up a build pipeline to automate the build process.
  - [ ] Define triggers for CI (e.g., pull requests, pushes to main branch).
  - [ ] Add build steps to restore dependencies, build the application, and run tests.

- [ ] **Creating Release Pipelines**
  - [ ] Set up a release pipeline for deploying the application to various environments (e.g., staging, production).
  - [ ] Implement approval workflows for deployments.

- [ ] **Integrating Tests in CI/CD**
  - [ ] Include unit and integration tests in the CI pipeline.
  - [ ] Ensure that tests must pass before allowing merges or deployments.

- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerts**
  - [ ] Set up monitoring for build and release pipelines.
  - [ ] Configure alerts for failures or issues in the pipeline.

- [ ] **Continuous Feedback**
  - [ ] Implement continuous feedback loops from users and stakeholders.
  - [ ] Use analytics to gather insights on deployments and application performance.

- [ ] **Managing Secrets and Configurations**
  - [ ] Use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets and sensitive configuration settings.
  - [ ] Ensure configurations are environment-specific and secure.

- [ ] **Improving CI/CD Process**
  - [ ] Review and optimize build and release pipelines for performance.
  - [ ] Implement best practices for managing dependencies and minimizing build times.
